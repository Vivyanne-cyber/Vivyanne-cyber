My name is Vivian. I am driven and passionate about Information Security because I understand the critical need and high demand for security professionals to help combat the increasing rate of cyber related crimes and incidents around the world and ensure a safe cyber world through collaborating and contributing to solutions that can positively impact an organization and the people it serves.
